- Feeds will be put into categorises so that each category has about 6 new posts in a day.
- When a feed usually has more than 2 new posts a day, assume there will be 2 posts a day.
- A category should have feeds with similar frequency.
- Categories should be named so that sorting them by name results in the increasing order of the frequency of the least-frequent feed in each category
